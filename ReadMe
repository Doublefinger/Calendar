1. Creative Portion: UI design (This really takes the most of time including writing the associated JQuery selector and also JS function closure). 
    Including serveral dropdown buttons with the right appearance and logic.
2. Calendar Share System. A can share calendar with B, so that B can view it through his page, but A can not view B's calendar unless B share it with A.


Comment: Because of the HTTP Header issue, this website might only work for Chrome Brower. FireFox and Safari retreate data as XML although I set header to Json manually.
